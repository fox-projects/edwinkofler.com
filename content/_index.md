Welcome! I'm a student currently transferring from [El Camino College](https://www.elcamino.edu) to [CSU San Marcos](https://www.csusm.edu).

I like to write devtools.

Related to that, I currently co-maintan [SchemaStore](https://github.com/schemastore/SchemaStore) and [git-extras](https://github.com/tj/git-extras); I also maintain [autoenv](https://github.com/hyperupcall/autoenv).

See more of my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/hyperupcall).
