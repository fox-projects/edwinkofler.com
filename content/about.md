What happened to my old site?

![Screenshot of old site](/images/old-site.png)

My old website was created with my own static site generator, [sauerkraut](https://github.com/fox-incubating/sauerkraut). I chose to build my own solution because I wanted full control over the build process and I wanted my code to last. But as it turns out, I didn't think through enough and I had to change things quite a bit, which caused a lot of incompatibilities. This website exists as somewhat of a stopgap until things have settled down.

This blog was built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with the [Monochrome](https://kaiiiz.github.io/hugo-theme-monochrome) theme.

The documents and files for this website can be found at [fox-projects/edwinkofler.com](https://github.com/fox-projects/edwinkofler.com).
