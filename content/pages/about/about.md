I like to learn and solve problems. In my free time, I like to cook, learn, and contribute to open-source projects.

## Now

After having attended [El Camino College](https://www.elcamino.edu) for several years now, I'm now applying for full-time computer engineering roles.

Software-wise, I'm focusing on writing a personal software solution for knowledge management called [quasipanacea](https://github.com/quasipanacea).

## Uses

- Surface Pro 5
- Kate

## Colophon

This website was created with my own static site generator, [sauerkraut](https://github.com/hyperupcall-experiments/sauerkraut). I chose to build my own solution because I wanted full control over the build process and I wanted my code to last (over decades).

The documents and files for this website can be found at [fox-projects/edwinkofler.com](https://github.com/fox-projects/edwinkofler.com).
