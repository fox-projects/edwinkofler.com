				ðŸ‘‹ Haii! I'm a student software engineer learning facts, skills, tools, and
				techniques for efficient development. These days, I'm building personal tooling to
				streamline my development workflow, irrespective of software ecosystem. If you
				like Bash, see my
				<a href="https://github.com/hyperupcall/repos#projects-bash">various</a>
				Bash <em>apps</em> and <em>libraries</em>.

				<h3>Woof</h3>
				<p>
					A version manager that works for nearly every language. It's essentially a fancy
					combination of rvm, nvm, pyenv, phpenv, etc. Currently, it supports 35+
					languages on x86_64, but the list is constantly growing. It is written in pure
					Bash and builds on
					<a href="https://github.com/hyperupcall/basalt">Basalt</a>, my Bash package
					manager.

				<h3>Basalt</h3>
				<p>
					A fully-featured package manager for Bash, among other shells. I gave a
					lightning talk for it at
					<a href="https://github.com/hyperupcall/slides">PackagingCon 2021</a>, showing
					features such as local and global projects, support for
					<em>actual Bash libraries</em>, and more! Along with Basalt, I have written
					numerous never-seen-before Bash libraries like
					<a href="https://github.com/hyperupcall/bash-object">bash-object</a>
					(nested data structures in Bash). See the full ecosystem
					<a href="https://github.com/hyperupcall/awesome-basalt">here</a>.

				<h3>autoenv</h3>
				<p>
					I currently maintain autoenv, a solution for constructing directory-based shell
					environments. As a pure-shell alternative to direnv, this project is used by
					thousands for ensuring certain directory-dependent environment variables,
					functions, etc. are dynamically available.

				<h3>Quasipanacea</h3>
				<p>
					A personal knowledge management solution. See
					<a href="https://github.com/quasipanacea/docs/blob/main/about/why.md">why</a>
					I'm building it, as opposed to using other solutions, such as Obsidian or
					TiddlyWiki. Currently in prototyping phase on
					<a href="https://github.com/quasipanacea">GitHub</a>.
