				ðŸ‘‹ Hellooo! I'm currently a student at

				<h3><a href="https://github.com/schemastore/SchemaStore">SchemaStore</a></h3>
				<p>
					When editing configuration files like <code>.prettierrc</code> or
					<code>.clang-format</code>, IDEs typically implement autocompletion and
					validation by fetching and evaluating
					<a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON Schemas</a> from
					<a href="https://www.schemastore.org/json/">schemastore.org</a>. I'm responsible
					for reviewing and merging pull requests that modify schemas, so that website
					consumers (who collectivelly download 2 terrabytes per day) don't download
					malformed or incorrect schemas.

				<h3><a href="https://github.com/hyperupcall/autoenv">autoenv</a></h3>
				<p>
					I currently maintain autoenv, a solution for creating directory-based shell
					environments. This project is used by thousands to ensure that certain shell
					scripts are evaluated, depending on which directories are <code>cd</code>'d to
					in a (typically interactive) shell session.

				<h3><a href="https://github.com/version-manager/woof">Woof</a></h3>
				<p>
					A language version manager that works for nearly every (popular) language. It's
					like a fancy combination of <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm">nvm</a>,
					<a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv">pyenv</a>
					<a href="https://github.com/rvm/rvm">rvm</a>, phpenv, and more! It currently
					supports 35+ languages on x86-64. It is written in Bash and builds on
					<a href="https://github.com/hyperupcall/basalt">Basalt</a>, my Bash package
					manager and my learnings from
					<a

				<h3><a href="https://github.com/bash-bastion/basalt">Basalt</a></h3>
				<p>
					A fully-featured package manager for Bash. I gave a lightning talk for it at
					<a href="https://github.com/hyperupcall/slides">PackagingCon 2021</a>, showing
					features such as local and global projects, support for
					<em>actual Bash libraries</em>, and more! Along with Basalt, I have written
					numerous never-seen-before Bash libraries like
					<a href="https://github.com/hyperupcall/bash-object">bash-object</a>
					(nested data structures in Bash). See the full ecosystem
					<a href="https://github.com/hyperupcall/awesome-basalt">here</a>.
